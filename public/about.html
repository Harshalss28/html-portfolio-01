<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m like a cup of coffee on a Monday morning—warm, energizing, and probably the reason you’re still functioning today.
   I’m the type of person who can find humor in almost anything, even my own clumsiness (which, let’s be honest, is legendary).
   I’ve mastered the art of procrastination, yet somehow always manage to pull things off at the last minute with style.
</p>

<p> When I’m not busy saving the world (or at least my plants from withering), I enjoy overthinking simple decisions 
  and appreciating the small wins—like finally remembering to take the laundry out of the dryer before it turns into a new species..
  I’m a work-in-progress, but who isn’t? Just here to be awesome, one quirky day at a time!</p>

<p>Yeah you know that I am awesome I don't need to mention that.</p>
